## Setup

1. Create a .env file to add your OpenAPI key in it (example in env_example file).
   
2. You need to create a virtual env to run the project in it (this step is required only on first setup): 
`python -m venv env`

3. You can now activate your env: 
`source env/bin/activate`

4. Once you're in your virtual env, you can install requirements:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. You can run the project:
`fastapi dev main.py`
